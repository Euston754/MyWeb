        <article>The <strong>African savannah elephant</strong> is the world's largest land mammal.It lives across many different habitats,including open savannahs,deserts, and forests. As these animals roam, they play an important role within their ecosystems.They disperse seeds through their dung,helping to fertilise the land; they clear paths through vegetation and overgrown bush,promoting plant diversity; and they use their tusks and feet to access water in dry riverbeds,creating small watering holes for other animals. African savannah elephants are found in <strong>23 countries across Africa</strong>They have populations in Kenya,Botswana,Namibia,Tanzania,South Africa,Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The IUCN classifies the African savannah as <strong>endangered</strong>This means itis at a very high risk of extinction in the wild.Their numbers are also decreasing.These elephants are poached for their <b>ivory</b> and their natural habitats are being converted into agricultural land and infrastructure by expanding human populations.IFAW is working to protect African savannah elephants and conserve their remaining habitat through our Room initiative. </article>
